    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question" id="programmingQuestions">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="programmingQuestions">

      I would create two data inputs for the program; one being the root MIDI to harmonize to,
      the other being how many semitones away should the plugin add the harmonizing note.
      When a number for the former is entered, it would be stored as a variable. When a MIDI note is recieved,
      it will output that number twice. The first time will be outputed as normal to a MIDI playback engine,
      the second we have the the stored number of the semitone added to it, then outputted with the original MIDI note.

    <div class="question" id="programmingQuestions">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.

    <div class="answer">

      Objects: Bell, Mouthpiece, Slide, Size/Type
      Properties: Pitch, Tone, Airflow, Articulation, Rhythym, Rest
      Events: articulateNote, moveSlide, press/releaseTrigger
      Methods: playPitch, playArticulation, playRhythm, playAirflow, Play Tone
